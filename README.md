# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

This project aims to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Introduction

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes include airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Preparation: Loading the CIFAR-10 dataset, preprocessing the images, and splitting them into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Model Development: Building a CNN architecture for image classification, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers.
3. Training and Evaluation: Compiling the model, training it on the training set, and evaluating its performance on the validation and test sets.
4. Performance Analysis: Analyzing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.
